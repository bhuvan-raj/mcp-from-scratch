## 🧭 Learning Path
### Level 1 -Foundations
- **[Module 1 – Introduction to MCPs](./Introduction%20to%20MCPs/)**  
  Covers the fundamentals of Model Context Protocol, including what MCP is, why it was created, problems with traditional AI integrations, comparisons with plugins and APIs, real-world use cases, and MCP’s role in modern AI systems.

- **[Module 2 – MCP Architecture](./MCP%20Architecture/)**  
  Explains the client–server model of MCP, the role of the LLM as the client, responsibilities of the MCP server, communication flow, stateless vs stateful interactions, and key security boundaries for safe and scalable AI integrations.

- **[Module 3 – Core MCP Concepts](./Core%20MCP%20Concepts/)**  
  Covers the essential building blocks of MCP, including tools, resources, prompts, transports, JSON schema fundamentals, and input/output validation, providing a foundation for safe and structured AI–tool interactions.

- **[Module 4 – MCP Transports](./MCP%20Transports/)**  
  Explains the communication channels between MCP clients and servers, including STDIO and HTTP/S transports, local vs remote MCP servers, when to use each transport, and the tool discovery mechanism for dynamic tool invocation.
  
- **[Module 5 – MCP Data Models](./MCP%20Data%20Models/)**  
  Explains how MCP defines and enforces data contracts, including tool definition structures, input and output schemas, structured error models, response formats, and schema-driven techniques to prevent hallucinations and ensure reliable AI–tool interactions.

- **[Module 6 – MCP Development Environment](./MCP%20Development%20Environment/)**  
  Covers the prerequisites and setup for MCP development, including required tools, choosing between Node.js and Python, an overview of the MCP SDK, recommended project folder structure, and running MCP servers locally for hands-on experimentation.
